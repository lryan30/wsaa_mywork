<b>hello</b>   

<script>
    console.log('hello')

# The above code is an example of an HTML document that contains a heading, a paragraph of text, and an example of an HTML element that applies bold formatting to text. It also includes a script element that logs "hello" to the console.
# The script element is used to embed JavaScript code within an HTML document, allowing for dynamic behavior and interactivity on the web page.
# The console.log() function is used to output a message to the browser's console, which can be useful for debugging and testing JavaScript code.
# In this case, the script logs the message "hello" to the console when the HTML document is loaded in the browser.
# This code demonstrates how HTML and JavaScript can be combined to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
